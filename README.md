    *How does Affirm use tech to its advantage? Why is it considered a fintech company?


Affirm uses big data to quickly process requests for loans. Can give decision within minutes rather than months.

    * Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?

First mover advantage in the BNPL sector. Affirm has solidified their positions in the FinTech industry by providing greater purchasing power for their customer base. Affirm provides clear, simple, and on the spot financing for online purchases. No late fees, service fees, prepayment fees, or hidden fees. One drawback for Affirm pertains to its highest APR of 30%, which is higher than most credit cards. The other downside to mention is that failure to payback an Affirm loan will negatively affect your credit score, although this is no different than most other credit facilities.

    * What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?

Affirm is one of the leading buy now, pay later companies. Revenue was up 55% in the most recent quarter, and the company increased its annual revenue estimates for 2022. Affirm remains a good long-term stock in a growing industry. Affirm expects to grow volume at about 60% in the first three months of calendar 2022 and they are also moving towards a new mix with smaller, shorter-term payments plans.

Affirm announced plans for the Affirm Card, the first U.S. debit card to have direct access to pay-over-time functionality. The Affirm Card will allow consumers to pay upfront, from their bank account, or pay later, by using a unique post-purchase feature. In just a couple of taps, consumers will be able to instantly convert any eligible transaction into one that is pay-over-time. As always with Affirm, there are no late fees or hidden charges, ever.
